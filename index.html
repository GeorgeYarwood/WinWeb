<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This website is a platform for my hobbiest projects. The main thing I wish to distribute here are smaller projects and tools which I think people will find useful.</p>
<p>If you know me from anywhere else you'll also know that I work in game development and create games in my spare time, which I will also link here.</p>

<p>The server powering this website is of my own creation, called WinWeb. It's a simple HTTP server using WinSock that can be downloaded from here.</p>
